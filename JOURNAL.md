Took an eternity, but I finally figured out how to mount the board in there!
Today I'm back in CAD. it took me forever, and quite a few revisions, but i finally got these things that will eventually support the pi kinda working, and properly mating, The ridges were a massive pain, even though they're key to my design:

Back in CAD today, and while mocking up witrh a Pi, I realized that the header I'm using isn't quite tall enough, so I'm going to have to replace it:

(if you zoom in you'll se that the USB ports is clipping into the PCB)

### June 6:
1hr

fuck around in cad/easyeda

### June 5:
2hrs

Started planning out my PCB in EasyEDA Pro, and I am now legitimately shocked how much of a struggle I can turn placing a single pin header into pf. 

### June 4:
School is finally out, so I now actually have time to get some work done. I previously started a CAD document, and now I finally linked it in this repo.

### May 19:
Set up basic repo, etc, also ordered some test components off of amazon.
