This project is the final boss of my trail project from ~1yr ago ([repo](https://github.com/TheTridentGuy/BlackboxHub), poorly documented, sorry). It's designed to be a full, battery powered Raspberry Pi setup encased in a durable, water-resistant case. It consists of a HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) that has 4 18650 batteries, and a display, mounted on a Raspberry Pi inside a Pelican M50 case. It also lets you have a full Linux machine in your backpack, that you can easily work on from a more convenient device, such as a phone. It also includes two extra WiFi interfaces for all your hacking needs.
